## Elive conky configuration files

These files are taken from Elive's beta 3.8 conky configuration.
They have been modified for 1920x1080 resolution. they will give you a much
better look for your conky monitor than the default one, something more 'Elive'
<br>
* Place all conky.... files into your home directory
* Make them hidden by prepending a dot
* Launch them with :
  <br>conky -c [file]<br>
once for each file. You should write a script that will do that for you!
(or use the one provided, just put it into /usr/local/bin/)
<br><br>
Enjoy!
