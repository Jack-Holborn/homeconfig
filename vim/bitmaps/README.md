## Gvim toolbar icons
You need to place icons from your own theme here. You should find them in
actions/ or places/ subfolder, but you may use anyone you like (what I did :-)
Please convert them into png format first, as vim doesn't yet recognize svg
format. Also keep the names as in this folder or modify menu.vim, your choice!

In case you missed it, these icons come from <a href="https://github.com/cbrnix/Newaita">Newaita</a> theme.
